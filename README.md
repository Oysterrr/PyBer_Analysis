# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to calculate the total weekly fares and also visualize it using a multi-line graph based on some ride-sharing data by different city types.

##Results
A summary dataframe is created to summarize and compare the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for different city types as below:

Even though there are more rides and drivers in suburban and urban cities than rural cities, the average fares per ride and driver are higher in the rural cities.

A multi-line grpah is created to compare the total fare for different city types over a 5-month period as below:

Since the urban and suburban cities have more rides and drivers, the total fares are highest in the urban cities, second highest in the suburban cities, and lowest in the rural cities. The graph shows that the total fares for three different city types have a similar trend which they all hit their peaks around late Feburary. There is also a large increase for the total fare for suburban cities at the end of April.

##Summary
In observance of the dataframe as well as the graph for this analysis, the business management should consider the following:
  1. Adjust and assign more drivers to the suburban and rural cities since the average fare per driver is higher than urban cities.
  2. Encourage more drivers to drive during the peak time period (late Feburary in this case).
  3. Conduct in-depth analysis using more data such as expense on drivers in different city types to analyze the company's profit
